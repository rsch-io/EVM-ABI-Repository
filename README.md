# EVM ABI Repository
This repository contains a collection of default ABIs (Application Binary Interfaces) for various smart contracts running on EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) blockchains, such as Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, and others. ABIs are essential for interacting with smart contracts, allowing developers to read data and invoke functions within these contracts
